# RF CTF RFID NFC Challenges

This should be considered a general list with general information for in person RFID/NFC challenges.

All challenges are subject to change and may be available only if the code or equipment is working.
Please check with staff if you have any questions.

## In Person
All challenges are currently only available in person.  We hope to add virtual RFID/NFC challenges in the future.  Good luck!

## Tools

For these challenges you should bring tools for Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID.

### LF and HF

Proxmark3 - The Swiss Army Knife of RFID research, paired with the bleeding edge RRG/Iceman firmware & client

### UHF

Most UHF readers are also capable of writing. 

Some good handheld options with internal antennas are the Zebra MC3190-Z which can be found on eBay for ($80-$130), or a more modern Zebra TC20 wth RFD2000 sled.

Industrial fixed position readers from Impinj or Alien also work well with external antennas.

UHF RFID Modules are another potential option for integrating into your kit:

# Challenges

## Physical Access Control System (PACS) Box
We didn't just bring a building in a box, we brought the parking lot as well. There will be a range of different credential technlogies (LF, HF, UHF), some you can get your hands on, and some placed out of reach requiring creativity and determination.  You will need to use a variety of tools (including a UHF RFID Reader/Writer) and techniques to interact with our access control system.

Our facility recently upgraded some of our credentials to a special secure bit format:

```
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCP
E E E E E E E E E E EO O O O O O O O O O O
```


### Rules
- Sets of cards will be available at the front table and spread out on a few contestant tables.
- You can interact with the badges, you can interact with the readers, but you can't take the badges to the readers.
- Do not reconfigure the readers.
- THIS IS A LEARNING JOURNEY, HAVE FUN!
