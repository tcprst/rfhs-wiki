# What is the RF Capture the Flag?

Do you have what it takes to hack WiFi, Bluetooth, and Software Defined Radio (SDR)?
RF Hackers Sanctuary (the group formerly known as Wireless Village) is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at GRIMMCon 0x4.

We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester’s determination, and $40 to $4000 worth of equipment.  Our new virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all!  The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.

## How do I play?

1. Make an account on the scoreboard by going to https://scoreboard.rfhackers.com/?wtf=login and clicking register.

2. Make a team or join a team when registering your user.

3. If you do not make or join a team you will go on team blah and **be unable to submit flags**.

4. Have fun and learn.


To score you will need to submit flags: https://scoreboard.rfhackers.com/?wtf=scoreboard

Challenges do not have to be solved in order. Difficulty ranges from easy to insane. Don’t dwell on only one problem.

You supply your own internet. We can see you, so be careful.


## Software Defined Radio (SDR) Challenges

You will run some scripts from [Here](https://github.com/rfhs/rfctf-sdr-tools) or create your own ZMQ receivers.
